Learning how photodna is made
i am making this for a part of my portfolio. it breaks down a photo into 16 pieces (for now) and makes it into a digital finger print.
to run this, open the batch file for "testingpy" batch file and use the IP https to run this. 
It will run flask. 
Use the beta testing folder to see the instructions if you would like to use your own!

for comparing hashes, I used: DB Browser (SQLite) with the database fill that is made from running the batch file.

all photos were done by me in my photography class elective.
